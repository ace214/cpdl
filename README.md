Scores of choral pieces engraved for publishing on CPDL

I use the open-source music engraving software, [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/), for all my music notation with the aid of the [Frescobaldi](http://frescobaldi.org/) editor.

You can view these editions on [the CPDL website](http://www1.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Jon_Arnold_editions).
